**Distillation of random tips**
- read recent papers in research area to get an understanding of the current problems and how to communicate it with the intended audience (authors of those papers)
- reproduce results of those papers and then implement their method for data you're interested in
- do the data science dirty work to make sure there is no stone unturned for end-to-end understanding of research solutions
- doing the above 3 things ensures that we'll make opinions about the problem, "which can result in a workable idea"
